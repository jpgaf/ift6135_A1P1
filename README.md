## Assignment 1 - Problem 1 
Run Q1.py for the problem 1 results.

## Dependencies:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- urllib
- gzip
- pandas
- seaborn

## Additional comment.
While Q1.py is the main code we used, we have also coded a different implementation for the MLP (probem1.py) for which we were able to validate our results.
